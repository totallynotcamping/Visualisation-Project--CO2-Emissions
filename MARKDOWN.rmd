I have used data from from Kaggle and The World Bank. Links to the datasets
are https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/global-environmental-indicators
and https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD respectively.

**ABSTRACT**  
In this project, we looked at data pertaining to CO2 emissions of various
countries, factors that would predict their levels and possible courses of
action. We used tools such as visualization and correlations to draw our conclusions.  
We found that prosperity predicts per capita levels of CO2 emission, that the
use of renewable energy inversely predicts CO2 emissions and that the Kyoto
Protocol has had a definite impact on emissions of greenhouse gases.

**INTRODUCTION**  
One of the biggest problems plaguing the modern world is climate change. It 
presents many challenges, one of which is that the world's temperature has
increased by 1.1&deg;C since 1880. One of the reasons for this is levels of
CO2 in our atmosphere. Since 1970, CO2 emissions by humans have increased by
about 90%. In this project, we will look at the data to create our conclusions
as to why CO2 levels are rising, and what we can do about it.   

**DATASETS**  
Here we have used 3 data sets:  
  
-*CO2*: CO2 emissions of 192 United Nations Members, in 1000 Tonnes. Rows are
values and columns are years.
```{r,warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
CO2_Emissions2 <- read.csv("C:/Users/heyit/OneDrive/Desktop/Mahir/DS1,2022/visuproject/Air and Climate/CO2_Emissions2.csv")
#Cleaning up some data, changing column names to year and converting data to
#numeric.
for (i in 3:32){
  colnames(CO2_Emissions2)[i]=CO2_Emissions2[1,i]
}
CO2=CO2_Emissions2[-c(1),]
CO2=CO2[-c(1)]
CO2=CO2 %>% 
  mutate_all(list(~ str_replace_all(., ",", "") %>% 
                    as.numeric %>%
                    replace_na(0)))
CO2$Country=CO2_Emissions2$Country[-c(1)]
```
-*GDPPC*: GDP per capita of various countries and others, 1960-2021.
```{r}
GDPPC <- read.csv("C:/Users/heyit/OneDrive/Desktop/Mahir/DS1,2022/visuproject/GDPPC.csv")
```
-*renewable*: Proportion of energy produced that is renewable of various
countries, in %.
```{r}
renewable <- read.csv("C:/Users/heyit/OneDrive/Desktop/Mahir/DS1,2022/visuproject/Energy and Minerals/Renewable elec production percentage.csv")
```
  
**GRAPH 1 - COUNTRIES WITH HIGHEST EMISSIONS**  
The first question that piques our curiosity is, what is the distribution of
CO2 pollution by country?

```{r, warning=FALSE}
#Downloading the world map and joining it with our data
mapdata=map_data('world')
colnames(mapdata)[5]='Country'
mapdata=left_join(mapdata,CO2,by='Country')
mapdata=mapdata %>% filter(!mapdata$Country=='Antarctica')
#Plotting
ggplot(mapdata,aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group))+  
  geom_polygon(aes(fill=log(mapdata$'1990')),color='Black')+
  scale_fill_gradient(name="Emissions Based On 1990 Data, Log Scale ",
                      low='yellow', high='#ff0000', na.value = 'grey50')+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.y=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.title = element_blank(),
        aspect.ratio = 1/2,
        rect = element_blank())
```

As you can see, many values are missing( shown by gray colour). Also,
Countries with a higher population have higher emissions, creating a bias.
Let us try something new.
    
**GRAPH 2: PER CAPITA DATA**  
Using emissions per capita hels us get a clearer picture. Also, there is more
data to work with.
```{r}
#Plotting
co2map=ggplot(mapdata,aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group))+
  geom_polygon(aes(fill=log(CO2.emissions..per.capita...latest.year)),
               color='Black')+
  scale_fill_gradient(name="Latest CO2 Emissions Per Capita ",low='yellow',
                      high='#ff0000', na.value = 'grey50')+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.text.y=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        axis.title = element_blank(),
        aspect.ratio = 1/2,
        rect = element_blank())
co2map
```

Here, you can see that industrialized nations seem to have more emissions, we
will test this hypothesis.
    
**Graph 3 - GDP AND EMISSIONS**  
We will try to find a relationship between GDP and emissions.
```{r}
#Preparing
colnames(GDPPC)[1]='Country'
GDPPC=left_join(GDPPC,CO2,by='Country')
GDPPC=GDPPC %>% filter(!is.na(GDPPC$X2020))
GDPPC=GDPPC %>% filter(!is.na(GDPPC$CO2.emissions..per.capita...latest.year))
GDPPC=GDPPC[-c(90),]#Removing outlier for plotting
#Plotting
ggplot(GDPPC,aes(x=X2020,y=CO2.emissions..per.capita...latest.year))+
  geom_point(colour='Dark Red')+
  labs(y='CO2 Emissions Per Capita, Latest',x='GDP Per Capita, 2020')+
  stat_smooth(method = "lm",
              formula = y ~ x,
              geom = "smooth")
```
```{r}
#Finding correlation
cor(GDPPC$X2020,GDPPC$CO2.emissions..per.capita...latest.year)
```

Here we see there is a strong relationship between GDP Per Capita and CO2
emissions.
    
**GRAPH 4- IMPACT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY**  
We will see if the usage of renewable energy can help us solve the problem
indicated by the last graph.
```{r}
colnames(renewable)[2]='Country'
renew=left_join(CO2,renewable,by='Country')
renew=renew %>% filter(!is.na(X2017))
ggplot(renew,aes(X2017,CO2.emissions..per.capita...latest.year))+
  geom_point(colour='blue')+
  labs(y='CO2 Emissions Per Capita, Latest',x='% Of Renewable Energy, 2017')+
  stat_smooth(method = "lm",
              formula = y ~ x,
              geom = "smooth")
```
```{r}
#Finding correlation
cor(renew$CO2.emissions..per.capita...latest.year,renew$X2017)
```

Here lies a weak relationship, indicating that the use of renewable energy 
can help us in our endeavor.
    
**GRAPH 5- KYOTO PROTOCOL**  
In its Annex B, the Kyoto Protocol sets binding emission reduction targets
for 37 industrialized countries and economies in transition and the European
Union. Overall, these targets add up to an average 5 per cent emission
reduction compared to 1990 levels over the five year period 2008â€“2012 (the
first commitment period).  
We will see if the Kyoto protocol has made an impact in the 20 countries that
signed its first commitment period.
```{r}
kyoto=CO2 %>% 
  filter(Country %in% c('Canada','Sweden','Norway','Japan',
                        'Switzerland','Hungary','Poland',
                                      'Latvia','Liechtenstein','Estonia',
                        'Ukraine','Australia','Iceland','Bulgaria',
                                      'Czechia', 'Romania','Monaco',
                        'New Zealand','Slovakia','Russia','Slovenia'))
kyotobar=data.frame(years=c('1990','2012'),sums=c(sum(kyoto$`1990`),
                                                  sum(kyoto$`2012`)))
ggplot(kyotobar,aes(x=years,y=sums,label=sums))+
  geom_col(fill=c('Yellow','Green'),colour='Black')+
  labs(x='Target Years',y='Pollution Levels (1000 Tonnes)')+
  theme(rect=element_blank(),axis.text.y=element_blank())+geom_label(vjust=0)
```

There seems to be a 17.96%
reduction in CO2 levels in the target period and the chosen countries,
indicating the effectiveness of the Kyoto protocol.    
**CONCLUSIONS**  
From the following data, we conclude that CO2 emissions vary between
countries, with wealthy countries emitting more CO2. This creates the problem
 of conflicting interests, specifically that of bringing disaffected
 populations out of poverty and of reducing carbon emissions. However, we see
 that the use of renewable energy and pacts like the Kyoto Protocol are
 helpful in battling the situation.
